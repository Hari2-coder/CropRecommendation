# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System (Java)

This is a **Java-based Crop Recommendation Project** that suggests the most suitable crops to cultivate based on multiple factors such as **soil pH**, **temperature**, **rainfall**, and **season**.  

It uses a CSV dataset containing global crop details and matches user input with ideal crop growth conditions. The project can be extended with a **frontend interface** for better user interaction.

How it Works

User provides soil/environment inputs (pH, temperature, rainfall, season)

The system loads dataset values from crops.csv

Each crop is checked against input conditions

Matching crops are recommended with additional details
